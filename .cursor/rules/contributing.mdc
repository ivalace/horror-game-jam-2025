Main overall story file is here: [story.mmd](mdc:story.mmd)
Each character has their own subfile for their portion of the story.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- ALL nodes must ALWAYS have human-legible-but-not-verbose IDs, visible within the graph nodes, on their own dedicated line of text within the node.
- DO NOT EVER change node IDs without explicit permission. Node IDs are responsible for syncing with external systems, so if they change unexpectedly that will cause breakage.
- NEVER change the text within existing nodes without explicit permission.
- NEVER change the flow of the existing nodes without explicit permission.
- NEVER inject new nodes into existing flows without explicit permission.
